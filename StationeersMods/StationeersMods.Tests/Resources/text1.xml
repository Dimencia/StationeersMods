    <Description>[h1]Time Mod[/h1]
        [b]WARNING:[/b] This is a StationeersMods Plugin Mod. It requires Bepinex to be installed with the StationeersMods plugin.
        See: https://github.com/jixxed/StationeersMods

        This mod adds the time to the days panel(bottom right) that was added to the game after being inspired by this mod.
        Only the current day was added, so this mod now also add the time to the panel and makes it a little less transparent to make it more readable.
